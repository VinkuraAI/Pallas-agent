## Why Pallas?

Mainstream chatbots sit behind restrictive firewalls, throttling your engineering potential. You repeatedly paste code, lose context, hit rigid token limits, and start over. 

**Pallas is the evolutionary successor to Hermes.** 
Pallas acts as your highly localized, autonomous co-pilot built entirely on a **Perception-Action-Reflection (PAR)** loop. It doesn't just answer questions—it drops into a sandbox, spins up a terminal, analyzes your codebase, parses APIs, and executes complex chains of tasks automatically until the job is done. 

It completely persists your identity and project history via a hyper-fast embedded SQL engine with Full-Text Search, recalling design decisions and past architectures across coding sessions. It's your personal Jarvis for elite engineering.

## 1-Click Global Installation

You can install Pallas globally onto your system using our install script. Simply run this command in your terminal from the root of the project:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

Once installed globally, you can initialize the agent from any directory by typing:
```bash
pallas start
```

## The 5-Brain Architecture

Our state-of-the-art multi-agent framework guarantees modular robustness:

1. **Conversation Layer**: The immersive interface. Elegant CLI routers and cross-platform message gateways (Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal) mapping states together.
2. **Agent Loop**: The actual "Brain". A deeply nested cycle enforcing step-by-step Reflections, Context Compression, and Trajectory Planning.
3. **Tool Sandbox**: Unfettered local power. Secure execution of bash commands, Python scripts, full modular file manipulation, and dynamic web extraction.
4. **Learning Memory**: `memories_fts`. An SQLite-backed hybrid store archiving every conversational turn to ensure massive context pruning logic.
5. **Infrastructure Layer**: Deep background routines allowing self-hosted jobs (Local Shell, Docker, SSH, Modal) to manage state persistence and scheduled tasks.

## The Skills Ecosystem

Pallas features a **closed-loop learning system**. When the agent performs complex tasks, it autonomously codifies that logic into reusable "Skills" stored in `~/.pallas/skills/`. These are portable markdown playbooks the agent uses to execute massive, repeatable workflows without manual oversight.

## Future Vector: Multi-Model Synthesis

Pallas is capable of querying both **Claude** (for high-level logic/coding) and **Gemini** (for massive long-context retrieval) in a single turn, synthesizing their specific strengths into a superior final output.

## CLI Usage

Pallas utilizes a massive `click` engine for professional management:

- `pallas start` - Enter the interactive agent loop.
- `pallas ask "..."` - Push a rapid one-shot task to the agent.
- `pallas doctor` - Run system diagnostics (API checks, binary setups).
- `pallas info` - Print the intricate architecture matrix and system design.
- `pallas help` - Explore all granular CLI routing commands.

### Pro-Tip: Autonomous Mode
Pass the `--no-approval` flag to run the agent completely autonomously. This bypasses the default `[Y/n]` firewalls for bash commands and unspools its true speed:
```bash
pallas start --no-approval
```
